# IPL-2025-Winner-Prediction

## 🏏 IPL Data Analysis & Winner Prediction

This project focuses on comprehensive data analysis of the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** from 2008 to 2024, with the goal of building predictive models to forecast the winner of the **2025 season**. We explore historical data, extract key insights, and implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
